The goal of the preamble is to prepare the project so that it's ready to be appropriated by the new comers !

It must be made clear, explicit, and easy to extend and modify for the work that will be done on v0.1.

This about project clean, organisation, and building a robust software architecture for everything that has been achieved until now.
