The target of this **v0.1** is a little playable prototype bit, to provide a first insight on the game design direction that are meant to be taken.

It should achieve a decent level of polish, but does not need to be bug-free of course.

# Brief

The idea is a small playable map, we will probably use the little sand pit idea, as it feels convenient to create a decent athmosphere with little resources, and extend it.

The map should be as small as possible to make it the simplest possible and avoid complex geometry interractions.  

Yet, the scale should be constrained by the components we want to express.
