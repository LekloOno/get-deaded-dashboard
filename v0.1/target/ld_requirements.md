Game design is developped first, and level design is only a tool to express the game design components.

Thus, this part is much shorter and less detailed, but might get developped as we will concretely dive into map design, to conceil the more specific solutions that we find to answer these requirements, just as [gd_requirements](gd_requirements.md) does for game design.

Just as for the game design too, the goal is to make the smallest simplest map possible, just enough to express the game design.

  - [Point A to Point B](#point-a-to-point-b)
  - [Rest](#rest)

# Tempo

Tempo is developped further in [gd_requirements:tempo](gd_requirements.md#tempo), but for short - it is the idea that the player wants to always be in a purely fighting phase as it is where he builds value, like score, but the game design does not allows him to do so, and he must earn his fighting phases.

This is very important to keep a game focused on such a "simple" thing as pure fundamental mechancis, interesting.

## Point A to Point B

> [gd_requirements:points](gd_requirements.md#point-a-to-point-b): Short - the player sometimes must fully commit to a movement, from one point A to another point B, most likely two points of interest.

This implies level cannot be too small, or at least, it must be thought as mutliple sub areas, with interconnected routes.

This could remain very small, as long as the player do clearly get that sense of "I'm fighting, and now i stop, and try to get to this place", in a chosen, non linear way.

What is also implied of such interconnected routes is that they should enable the player movement skills - providing interesting routes alternatives.

More details of what should be exploited, and how it could be exploited, are explained in the game design report.

## Rest

> [gd_requirements:points](gd_requirements.md#point-a-to-point-b): Short - the player sometimes must rest. Stop any on going action, find a safe, defensive position, and rest.

This implies level must include some covers, places to hide, and enough space so that the player can break distance long enough to rest from a dangerous situation.
- If there's covers, but it's super small, it'll probably be next to another danger anyways, or will reach him too soon.
- If it's large, but there's no covers, it'll still be in sight of far away dangers.
